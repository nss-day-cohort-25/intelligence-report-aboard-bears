            <h3>90%</h3>
            <p>The radio has become a dangerous place. Even if you avoid playing one yourself, they are often publicly broadcasted
                in malls, stores, one may even bombard your eardrums at a mechanic shop. This crime may be unpreventable
                so bring headphones everywhere to minimize damage, should it occur</p>

            <h3>12%</h3>
            <p>Though Apple took lots of flack for their involvement with U2, they seem to have taken a malicious turn since
                the loss of their zen founder. They do have to keep the books in the black but this horrible concept appeals
                to their inherent depravity. God help those of you with Macs and iPhones. It is less likely to happen, but
                there is absolutely nothing you can do if you are an Apple user. You'll never swap Android, so just take
                this one on the chin and avoid using the standard music player with apps like Spotify.</p>

            <h3>3%</h3>
            <p>I mean, you aren't listening to playlists with music that could be associated with someone this truly horrendous
                so this is an area of least concern. Try to avoid anything related to Disney or targeted toward tweens and
                there shouldn't be an issue. In any case, simply be aware that this could affect friends and family members.
                Remain vigilant and protect your eardrums.</p>

            <h3>Almost Nowhere Remains Unaffected</h3>

            <p>Though it may feel ubiquitous in its scope, there are some areas that have escaped her influence. Here are a
                few:
            </p>

                <li>Uzbekistan</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Agency Investigation of Crimes</h3>

            <p>Everyone has been affected in acts ranging from mental abuse to physical harm, from financial losses direct and
                indirect, and all have scars that will linger as reminders. Every agency with investigative powers has become
                involved. Official investigations are ongoing in:</p>

            and he was my father. And my mother... my brother... my friend. He was you... and me. He was all of us." - Evey
