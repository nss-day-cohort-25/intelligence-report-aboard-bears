    <h2>Will It Happen to YOU?</h2>
    
    <h3>90%</h3>
    <p>The radio has become a dangerous place. Even if you avoid playing one yourself, they are often publicly broadcasted in malls, stores, one may even bombard your eardrums at a mechanic shop. This crime may be unpreventable so bring headphones everywhere to minimize damage, should it occur</p>
    <h3>12%</h3>
    <p>Though Apple took lots of flack for their involvement with U2, they seem to have taken a malicious turn since the loss of their zen founder. They do have to keep the books in the black but this horrible concept appeals to their inherent depravity. God help those of you with Macs and iPhones. It is less likely to happen, but there is absolutely nothing you can do if you are an Apple user. You'll never be able to learn how to use Android, so just take this one on the chin and avoid using the standard music player with apps like Spotify.</p>

    <h3>3%</h3>
    <p>I mean, you aren't listening to playlists with music that could be associated with someone this truly horrendous so this is an area of least concern. Try to avoid anything related to Disney or targeted toward tweens and there shouldn't be an issue. In any case, simply be aware that this could affect friends and family members. Remain vigilant and protect your eardrums.</p>
